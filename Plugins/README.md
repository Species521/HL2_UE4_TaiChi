# What are the UX Tools?

UX Tools for Unreal Engine is a UE game plugin with code, blueprints and example assets created to help you add in features commonly needed when you're developing UX for Mixed Reality applications.

| NOTE: Only HoloLens 2 development is supported at the moment. |

# Getting started with UX Tools

If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development in Unreal, **we recommend starting at the beginning of our** [Unreal development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unreal-development-overview) in the Microsoft Docs. The Unreal development journey is specifically tailored to walk new developers through the installation, core concepts, and usage of the UX Tools.

| CAUTION: The Unreal development journey currently uses **UX Tools 0.10.x** and **Unreal 4.25.4+**. |

If you're already familiar with Mixed Reality development in Unreal, you can find the installation instructions for the UX Tools plugin [here](Docs/Installation.md).

# Example maps

If you want to explore the different UXT features or want a reference for how to use them, we recommend having a look at the example maps contained in the _UX Tools Game_ (/UXToolsGame) in this repository. For that you should:

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) this repository.
1. [Checkout](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/switching-between-branches) the latest 'public/_version_.x' branch.
    * Bear in mind that this branch is alive. It's not a release, and will be **updated regularly with potentially breaking changes**. There will be a release tag (e.g. _release/0.10.0_) marked as such in GitHub.

You can now open the _UX Tools Game_ (/UXToolsGame) and explore individual example maps or open the _Loader_ level to access some of the examples from a centralized hub.

# Packaged UX Tools Game

We also provide the _UX Tools Game_ pre-packaged for HoloLens 2 so you can try out the main UXT features directly on device easily. To use it:

1. Obtain the packaged game from the latest release page (e.g. _UXTGame-HoloLens.0.10.0.zip_) and unzip it to a local directory.
1. Install it in the device via the [Device Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal#install-sideload-an-app).
