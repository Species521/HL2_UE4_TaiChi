/**
 * The follow component has three different constraints that keeps its owner in front of the camera: Angular
 * Clamp, Distance Clamp, and Orientation. The combination of Angular and Distance Clamp creates a
 * frustum in front of the camera where its owner can be. If its owner is outside that frustum
 * it is adjusted.
 *
 * Angular Clamp: The objective of this constraint is to ensure that the reference forward vector remains
 * within the bounds set by the leashing parameters. To do this, determine the angles between toTarget
 * and the leashing bounds about the global Z-axis and the reference's Y-axis. If the toTarget falls
 * within the leashing bounds, then we don't have to modify it. Otherwise, we apply a correction
 * rotation to bring it within bounds. This will ensure that the its owner stays within the
 * top, bottom, right and left planes of the frustum.
 *
 * Distance Clamp: The objective of this constraint is to ensure that the following actor stays within bounds
 * set by the distance parameters. To do this, we measure the current distance from the camera to the
 * its owner. If the distance is within the MinimumDistance and MaximumDistance then we don't have to
 * modify it. Otherwise, we push away or pull in the its owner along the reference forward vector.
 * This will ensure that the its owner stays within the near and far planes of the frustum.
 *
 * Orientation: The two options provided are constant FaceCamera or WorldLock. While world locked there are
 * three conditions that will cause the its owner to face the camera:
 * 	Angular Clamps
 * 	Distance Clamps
 * 	The angle between the forward vector of the its owner and toTarget vector (vector between
 * 		the camera and the its owner) is larger than dead zone angle parameter
